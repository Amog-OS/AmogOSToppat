![AmogOS Toppat](amogostoppat.png)

AmogOS 2.0 Toppat is a reimagination of the AmogOS operating system, themed around Among Us's fourth map - the Airship

## Features (Nothing is final here, and may be cancelled/changed)

- Installable, and aims to support Debian and Arch (btw) systems

- Architecture independent script

- Will mostly re-implement all the original features

- Toppat themed (still sussy, dont worry.)

- More sus apps

- Usage of more generic install images to ensure hardware compatibility, followed by a script that makes things very sus.

## Developers

- With our great thanks to the original devs of AmogOS 1.x (All Imposter Devs, Nooz Daddy & Moon Mommy, asmins, and others) for guiding us, inspiring us and helping us continue the majestic legacy of AmogOS.

## Notes

    We are not responsible for ANY KIND OF DATA LOSS or any kind of problem not relating to AmogOS, USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
    AmogOS was never intended to be a replacement for mainstream distributions; it's merely a joke and a sussy OS.
