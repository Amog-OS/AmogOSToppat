![AmogOS Toppat](amogostoppat.png)

AmogOS 2.0 Toppat is a full remake of the AmogOS operating system, themed around the earlier works by Innersloth, the Henry Stickmin games.

## Features (Which have been confirmed)

- All ports will run on Linux Kernel 6.9 when it releases (All Alphas, Betas and few Release Candidates will run older kernels)

- The ports are x64, arm64, and armhf/arm32

- Will mostly re-implement all the original features

- Toppat themed (still sussy, dont worry.)

- Henry Stickmin games with open source Flash engine

## Developers

- [@everytab](https://github.com/Everytab) - arm64 and armhf port

- @IAMACAR going to provide numerous sus programs and help

- [@Get-DevVed-YT (Ved Rane)](https://github.com/Get-DevVed-YT/) - x64/amd64 port

- With our great thanks to the original devs of AmogOS 1.x (All Imposter Devs, Nooz Daddy & Moon Mommy, asmins, and others) for guiding us, inspiring us and helping us continue the majestic legacy of AmogOS.

## Notes

    We are not responsible for ANY KIND OF DATA LOSS or any kind of problem not relating to AmogOS, USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
    AmogOS was never intended to be a replacement for mainstream distributions; it's merely a joke and a sussy OS.
